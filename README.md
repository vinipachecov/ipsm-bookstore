# church-library-app
An app to help my church to organize their library and book store management.

## About it

My church has a library and a currently sells books with the only intention to sell good material at a good price. They have realized that the current desktop system of the bookstore doesn`t have some features they would like, as:

* Check what books are currently available
* Login with valid credentials to Firebase backend
* Edit/Add/Remove books for valid users


## Techs
* React Native
* Native Base(UI)
* Firebase
