# church-library-app
An app to help my church to organize their library and book store management. I've choosen React-Native as my framework because I have professional experience with it rather than Kotlin or Java.

## About it
My church has a library and a currently sells books with the only intention to sell good material at a good price. My church brothers realized they needed to know beside their desktop what books were available, so I thought a simple app would help them to manage this.  

* Check what books are currently available in the cloud
* Login with valid credentials to Firebase backend
* Edit/Add/Remove books for valid users


## Techs
* React Native
* Native Base(UI)
* Firebase

# Running
Go to the project folder and run:
```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

After that we need to run the package manager:
```
yarn start
```
or 
```
npm start
```

If you have a android device, connect it with programmer settings available or open an device emulator (android) and then run the command:
```
react-native run-android
```

The app is not builded for IOS.

You will need to add a firebase app setting to run this by creating a config folder and importing it on app.js file. Check our app on GooglePlay to know it better:
